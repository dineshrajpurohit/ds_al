# Data Structure and Algorithms implementation using Python
The repo consisting of implementation of all the data structure and algorithms I have written over the time. 

I also have included solution (in python) for the exercise from Algorithms 4th edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. 

I will try to update the repo whenever I can. 

I would suggest attempting to solve the exercise by yourself before foing through these solutions.
